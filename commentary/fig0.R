Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, fieldwork for the YLT survey was not completed in 2020 and no data was produced for that year; therefore, the YLT data referenced in this report with regards to change from the previous year are from 2019. Any time series graphs affected by the missing data have been clearly marked. Please see the technical notes section for further details.")
